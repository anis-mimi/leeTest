When Volley founders Max Child and James Wilsterman made a decision to pivot their mobile app production consultancy to a voice games publisher, they by no means expected to have the top-rated game titles in the Alexa Skills Retailer. While those skills received Volley a respected place in the tone of voice industry, they knew that monetization was the next phase to growing their organization. And that intended creating premium experiences to market to customers.

“The thing about running a company is you will have to get to the next level,” says Kid. “Monetization may be the next great home based business for voice developers.”

In under 12 months, Volley’s game titles proved to be amidst the virtually all engaging, amassing over 500,000 active regular users and quickly becoming a top earner in the Alexa Developer Rewards system. Nonetheless it was the addition of in-skill getting that allowed Volley to level. It began selling premium articles in the type of expansion packs for its preferred Yes Sire role-playing experience game. Kid says the conversion charge of customers purchasing expansion packs is much greater than cellular, and he feels this bodes very well for future years of sustainable businesses built with Alexa.

“Having the ability to offer in-skill purchases, we found an important piece of the puzzle to grow our business by bringing even better experience to players,” says Child.

## Embracing the Prospects and Rewards of Voice

Kid and Wilsterman recognized that the portable app space had way back when become overcrowded with video games. When Kid received an Amazon Echo as a birthday present, they saw the possibility to provide their big ideas to life via voice.

“The coolest thing about voice-controlled games is that they can enable a live multiplayer experience,” says Child. “Tone of voice gives us a unique power and a distinctive opportunity to create social encounters in a way that the web and mobile actually didn't.”

Volley’s primary breakout skill, Melody Quiz, is a multiplayer game that problems listeners to guess a song’s brand and artist from a brief sound snippet. Their latest top-rated skill can be Yes Sire, a fantasy role-playing game where in fact the customer assumes the function of a ruling squire in a medieval kingdom.

These games-and greater than a 50 % dozen others from Volley-have a lot more than 1,000 five-star ratings in the Alexa Abilities Retailer. They’ve been so good that they catapulted Volley to a high earner in the Alexa Programmer Rewards program, which will pay developers of skills driving a number of the highest customer engagement.

“The Alexa Programmer Rewards program was the spark for the complete company that people have today,” says Kid. “The program allowed us enhance our skill by hiring other writers to help expand the volume of content we released there.”

## Delivering Superior Content to Deepen Consumer Engagement

By using Alexa Developer Rewards, Volley proved its voice-first technique for its game studio was a good choice. Now Child aspires to create Volley a leader in the voice-managed entertainment space, and monetization may be the critical factor for doing that vision.

“Our goal is to build game titles that persons can play for thousands of hours, but that requires a significant investment in both content and game style,” says Child. “We believe being able to directly monetize the partnership with our clients is critical to cause this to be investment and providing on that target.”

In Yes Sire, Volley now offers in-skill buys by offering expansion packs to supply extra scenarios and questions in the experience story. This premium content yields income that Volley can reinvest in establishing their organization with Alexa.

“In-skill buys allow us to market something of value right to our customers, which allows us to make the investment necessary to continuously increase the skills,” says Child. “Those improvements support us attract and maintain more clients, which fuel our growth and allow us to invest more to deliver even more value.”

Building Engaging Skills That Consumers Love and Want to cover
The addition of Yes Sire’s premium expansion packs has already been paying down for Volley. Regarding to recent five-star evaluations, Yes Sire players will be excited about the excess premium content. And Child is excited to observe how many customers already are purchasing the brand new expansion packs.

“Our customers' a reaction to the growth pack has been extremely great,” says Child. “The persons who love playing Yes Sire have always wanted to play more, and it's really really exciting to be able to present them the extended, narrative experience they want.”
